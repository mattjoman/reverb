#Scraper
The scraper worked as of December 2020, but may not anymore as it is heavily dependent on the source code of Reverb.com

Running scraper.py will scrape guitar listing info from Reverb.com and save it to raw_data.csv

#Data Cleaning + Feature Engineering
Running ft_eng.py will do some basic cleaning and create some new features

The resulting data is saved to processed_data.csv
